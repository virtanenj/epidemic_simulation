# Toy model for studying epidemics (work in progress)

Mainly intuition based model for simulating epidemics with following functions:
- Random walk: model the movement of each individual
- SIR model: state of each individual
- Stochasticity in infection: modelling different diseases or disease spread prevention
- Visualization of the model
- Statistics


The goal is to make the model increasingly detailed and follow real world epidemics as closly as possible.
